-Moved all of the extra parts cfgs to VenStockRevamp/Part Bin, in case players don't want more parts.

Version 1.5 of Ven's Part Revamp:
-FuelTank
	>added a new line of 0.625m tanks
-Engines
	>All the 2.5m engines are done
-Structural
	>Panels, I-beams and Girders are done.

Version 1.4 of Ven's Part Revamp:
-FuelTank

	>Remade all of the 2.5m tanks, they all now refer to one texture for Ram reduction
	>Changed the shade of several parts to bring them inline with the SPP parts
	>Added a new, simpler texture map for the SPP wings.
	>RCS Tanks are done and refer to a single texture map.

Fixed some fairing issues on the LT-v30 and 45.
Added some alternate parts.

Version 1.3 of Ven's Part Revamp
-Engines
	>Remade all of the 1.25m Engines
-FuelTank
	>Did all of the 1.25m fuel tanks

.25 folder change + most files are now .mbm instead of .TGA. They now overwrite most of the original texture files (so the old textures don't take up your RAM)

Version 1.2 of Ven's Part Revamp

Added Module Manager. (thanks to Taverius for helping)

-Command
	>new MK1 with emmissive
	>changed the collider to 1-2 pod
	>New Crew cabin
-Utility
	>added new parachutes and animations, new textures, etc.
	>New 2.5m decoupler.
	>new 1.25m decoupler.
	>New Docking ports.
-Engine
	>redid the short SRB, now has a fairing.
	>New sepatron with ledgeable text. Now uses the FX from the LES.
	>Added a mini sepatron
-Science
	>remade the long antenna, now collides with objects when it is extended.

Version 1.1 of Ven's Part Revamp
Changes:
-Command
	>added a new model/texture for the 1-2 pod
-Utility
	>Added new models and textures for the RCS block and linear RCS.
	>Added a spinning animation for the circular intake
	>Remade the old science instruments

-fixed the radial engine body and inline intake.


Version 1.0 of Ven's Part Revamp

Changes: (all models should have a better pixel density now, due to mirroring)
-Aero
	>retextured the Advanced Canard and reduced its texture size (1024x to 512x).
	>Remodeled Aileron, new texture. Same for the Small Aileron.
	>Remade the Airplane Tail (increased sides to 24) and texture.
	>Remodeled the Delta Wing, and retextured it.
	>remodeled NCS Adapter, still hate the thing. Now 20 poly sides instead of 18.
	>Remodeled The Standard nose cone (now 20 sides, up from 18), new texture. Collider changed to fit better.
	>remodeled the Swept Wing, and gave it a new texture.
	>Remodeled The Tailfin, altered the collider to make it easier to place things on the back. New texture.
	>Wing Connector was remodeled, and given a new texture
	>R8 winglet was remmapped, gave it new textures, and some emmissive lights.
	>The Delta-Delux Winglet was retextured, looks nearly the same to the original, but with a specular map.
	>Lightly redid the normal nose cone, got rid of that nasty seam. Reduced texture size.
	>Redid the Canard controller.
	>Remapped and retextured the rocket nosecone (2.5m).

-Command
	>Remade the Avionics Nosecone. Changed the collider to fit. Gave the lens an emmissive. Now 20 poly sides instead of 18.
	>Remodeled and retextured the MK2 Lander Can. New collider, so it wont be so awakward to place things on. Added a window looking up in the viewport.
	 Added A light emmissive for the fun of it.

-Engine
	>remodeled part of the MK55 Radial Engine, Extended the mounting arm and remade the engine bell. Retextured. The engine bell now gimbals 
	and has a heat emmissive (this is the one part in this pack that requires its config).
-FuelTank
	>MK1 Fuselage was remodeled and simplified, retextured too, same for its structural counterpart.now 20 poly sides instead of 18.
	>remodeled the 2.5m RCS tank.
-Structural
	>1.25m short adapter was retextured (just a resize of the 2.5m variant)
	>Remodeled The Inline Intake, looks much better now.
	>Radial Engine Body was also redone.
	>enlarged the collider for the Structural Pylon, it is much easier to click it now. Fixed so that it now leaves a base when decoupled. Needs it's CFG.
	>Structural Wing was remodeled and retextured. 
	>Remodeled the small standoff/Pylon/whatever. (part no longer has a normal map)
-Utility
	>The Circular Intake was remodeled and retextured.now 20 poly sides instead of 18.
	>The large Adapter (2.5m to 1.25m, tall one) was remapped and retextured, same for its slim partner.
	>Remodeled the Ram Intake. now 20 poly sides instead of 18. Quick and crappy.


TLDR: Upped the Pixel resolution to get more bling, for the same price, and cleaned up the models to make them beautiful.
