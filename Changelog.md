Changes for KSP 1.4:

* Support for localisation
* +PART patches expanded into full PART nodes (so that parts added by VSR are properly identified as such by Filter Extension)
* Added support for inflatable crew module feature
* Adjusted node positions of Ven's new Poodle model so that 'upgraded' vehicles don't have the bell sticking down into the decoupler below.
	* Moved old VSR Poodle model to new O-80 "Gale" Service Engine part (size 2 monoprop engine).
* Re-enabled revamped wheel models (thanks @Enceos)
* Re-enabled giant SpaceX-style landing gear (thanks @notquitehalf)
* Added Part Variant support to Ven's engine models with optional tankbutts.
* Added Ven's textures and models as default variants of aerodynamic fairings and Rockomax (size 2) tanks.
* Added VSRexclude switch -- set "VSRexclude = true" in a part config and VSR will not swap its stock model(s) for Ven's versions.
* Balanced CryoX and soft fuel tanks for updates to CryoTanks.
* Adjusted node positions of several models to fit better and reduce thrust offset.
* Restored Ven's old aerospike model on top of Porkjet's.
* Lights no longer illuminate planets from orbit.

Changes for KSP 1.5:

* Added fuel to Rockomax-48 fuel tank...
* Added Ven's models as default variants of revamped Mk1 pod, Stayputnik, OKTO, OKTO2, QBE, HECS, HECS2, and RoveMate probe cores, and FL-T (size 1) fuel tanks.
* Added new RT-10-G SRB to use Ven's model (with gimbals).

Changes for KSP 1.6:

* Added Ven's models as default variants of revamped multicouplers, Rockomax and FL-T adapters, and nose cones (Aerodynamic Nose Cone and Protective Nose Cone Mk7).
	* Added new ADTP-3-2-H part, as a special lightweight hollow adapter between size 2 and 3 parts.  (Squad's revamped model is a fuel tank, so Ven's model doesn't apply to it.)
	* Fixed Rockomax tanks.
* Ven's old Poodle model returns to revamp Squad's revamped Poodle model.
	* Marked O-80 "Gale" service engine as deprecated (TechHidden = true), to be removed in a future update.
* Ven's engine models now overwrite Squad's revamped Poodle, Spark, Terrier, RT-5, and RT-10 engine models.
	* RT-10-G SRB removed.
* Adjusted node and fairing positions of Skipper and Poodle models, to reduce interference with other parts.
* Adjusted node positions of heat shields (and Ven's Mk1 pod model) to fit better with flat-bottomed parts.
* Changed the transform names of the vernier thrusters on the Size2MedEngine (RE-D7 "Bollard"), so they can have separate thrusts and FX groups.

"Changelog" for users installing Ven's Stock Revamp on KSP 1.6:

* Most parts in the base game (i.e. not from Making History or any future expansions) get completely replaced, but there are a handful of exceptions:
	* Spaceplane parts are generally left alone.  (The "Wheesley", "Whiplash", and "Panther" engines get some decorative turbomachinery added to the front of them.)
	* Squad's revamped fuel tanks, adapters, and probe cores are still available as variants (though Ven's models are now the default variant for them).
	* The revamped Mk1-3 pod and Mk2 Lander Can models are left alone, because their IVAs have changed significantly and no longer fit with Ven's models (and they look nice enough).
* New parts that fill some gaps in the stock range, including half-sized deployable solar panels, structural girders in multiple sizes and configurations, and a range of Oscar 0.625m fuel tanks.
