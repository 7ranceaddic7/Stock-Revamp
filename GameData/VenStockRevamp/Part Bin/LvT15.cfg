title = LV-T15 "Dachshund" Liquid Fuel Engine
manufacturer = Jebediah Kerman's Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.
description = The Lv-T15 Dachshund is one of the earliest rocket engines on our records, breaking altitude records and bones alike. Even today, the old stinker is still competitive after all this time by having the highest TWR of the LV-T series, but at the cost of the engines nozzle being blasted away over time, not to mention it's inability to throttle itself. What? At least we figured out how to cool our engines by now.
